### Data Scientist | UX Researcher | Terrible Data Generalist

I'm a UX Researcher/Data Scientist, specializing in early-stage product analytics, research planning, and root cause analysis. I have a qualitative research toolset from my background in I/O Psychology and a wealth of practical experience with UX analysis and data engineering. If you need to cross the gap between quantitative and qualitative research, I'm available for hire.

Since I work with finance and healthcare companies, most of my work products are protected information.  To give a taste of what I can do, I've created some small projects in R, Python, and SQL to prove my technical skill.  (I also have a _lot_ of half-completed projects, Jekyll templates, and notes repos.)
