## Hello, Internet Strangers ğŸ‘‹

I'm a data archeologist, humming the Indiana Jones theme song.  I love getting to bridge the gaps between different data sets, departments, and designs to grow towards a better system.  


### A little about me...

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about scalable machine learning
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on creative gaming projects
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about user interface research and design
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love making the perfect office set-up
