### Data Scientist | UX Researcher | Terrible Data Generalist

I'm a UX Researcher/Data Scientist, specializing in early-stage product analytics, research planning, and root cause analysis. I have a qualitative research toolset from my background in I/O Psychology and a wealth of practical experience with UX analysis and data engineering. If you need to cross the gap between quantitative and qualitative research, I'm available for hire.
